## Ground rules (identical for every wave-two task)

Read `AGENTS.md` at the repository root first. It states the architecture decisions
you are building inside, not suggestions.

**You own exactly one layer directory. Everything else is frozen.**

Frozen, and you must not edit any of it: the repository root (`package.json`,
`pnpm-lock.yaml`, `nuxt.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`,
`eslint.config.mjs`, `knip.ts`, `drizzle.config.ts`), `drizzle/`, `server/`,
`app/`, `shared/`, and every `layers/*` directory other than your own.

Three consequences, each of which has bitten this repository before:

- **No new dependencies.** Everything you need is installed: `drizzle-orm`, `zod`,
  `reka-ui`, `qrcode`, `better-auth`, Tailwind v4, Vitest, Playwright. If you
  genuinely need one more, stop and report it instead of editing the manifest.
- **No schema changes.** Do not edit any `shared/schema.ts`, do not run
  `drizzle-kit generate`, do not add a migration. The schema and the two
  migrations on master are the contract. If a column you need is missing, stop
  and report it, then build against what exists.
- **No seed changes.** `server/database/seed.ts` already seeds realistic Spanish
  data across every table, including a graded student, an ungraded student, a
  pre-issued row and a deliberately stale row. Run `pnpm db:seed` and build
  against it.

**Design system.** `layers/base/app/components/` has Button, Input, Checkbox,
Textarea, Badge, Skeleton, EmptyState, Pagination, Toaster, and reka-ui-backed
dialog, popover, select, table, tabs, tooltip, dropdown-menu, breadcrumb,
command-palette. Import them. Do not reinvent them, and do not edit them. If a
primitive is missing, compose one inside your own layer from the tokens in
`app/assets/css/main.css`; do not reach into `layers/base` to add it.

**Data flow is direct.** Nitro route handler validates with Zod, queries with
Drizzle, returns a typed object. No repository layer, no service layer, no DTO
mapping. The two exceptions in `AGENTS.md` (auth domain rules, the issuance
state machine) are not yours.

**Auth.** Every server route that touches privileged data calls
`requirePermission(event, '<permission>')` from
`layers/auth/server/utils/require-permission`. The permission strings are the
union in `layers/auth/shared/domain/rbac.ts`. Never check `role === 'admin'`
inline.

**Verify before you report done.** `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`,
`pnpm build`, plus one direct check against `pnpm dev` with real seeded data
(curl the routes you wrote, load the pages you wrote). A passing unit test on a
pure function is not evidence that a page renders. If something fails, say so
with the output; do not report success on a partial run.

**Do not commit and do not push.** Leave your work uncommitted in the worktree.
